# ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - Need GitHub Copilot Help

## Problem Summary
Task Tracker app keeps failing on Render deployment with MODULE_NOT_FOUND error for `/opt/render/project/src/server.js`

## What We've Tried
1. âœ… Created render.yaml with explicit paths
2. âœ… Used npm start in render.yaml  
3. âœ… Removed render.yaml for auto-detection
4. âœ… Created root-level start.js proxy
5. âœ… Removed conflicting backend/package.json
6. âœ… Created src/server.js (what Render expects)

## Current Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (main frontend)
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js (frontend JS)
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css (styling)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (main config, points to src/server.js)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js (NEW - server where Render expects it)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js (original working server)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tasks.json (data storage)
â””â”€â”€ start.js (proxy script - may not be needed now)
```

## Error Pattern
Render consistently looks for `/opt/render/project/src/server.js` despite our configurations

## GitHub Copilot Questions
1. Is our src/server.js implementation correct for Render deployment?
2. Should we remove the backend/ directory entirely?
3. Are there Render-specific configurations we're missing?
4. Is the path resolution in src/server.js correct for serving static files?

## Expected Behavior
- App should deploy successfully on Render
- Frontend should serve from root (index.html, script.js, style.css)
- API endpoints should work (/api/tasks, etc.)
- Tasks should persist in backend/tasks.json

## Local vs Deploy Difference
- Works perfectly locally with backend/server.js
- Fails consistently on Render regardless of configuration attempts
